# onion

This is the design system for my side-projects, and a place for me to try out ideas in my component design.

## Usage

The purpose of this project is to serve me and my projects. While you are more than welcome to use it, do so at your own risk.

In `.npmrc` you'll want to include this line:

```
@chiptopher:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then to install:

```bash
npm install @chiptopher/onion@0.2.10
```
